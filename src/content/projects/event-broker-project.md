This project is a simple proof of concept event broker system built using Node.js. The event broker is designed to facilitate event driven systems such as game backends, microservices, or any system that benefits from decoupled communication. The event broker allows for the publishing and subscribing of events, enabling different parts of a system to communicate without direct dependencies on each other. The project includes a basic implementation of the event broker, along with example usage and documentation on how to integrate it into your own projects.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: Used for building the event broker service.
- TypeScript: Used for type safety and improved developer experience.
- Event Driven Architecture: The design pattern used to create a decoupled communication system.
- Service Design: The event broker is designed as a standalone service that can be easily integrated into various systems.
