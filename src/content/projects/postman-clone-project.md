Project Raygun is a light attempt to clone the basic functionality of the popular API testing tool Postman. Build using React as its presentation layer, typescript for type safety and Axios for making HTTP requests, the project aims to offer users a simple interface to create and send HTTP requests, view responses, and manage collections of requests. The project includes features such as support for various HTTP methods, the ability to add headers and body data to requests, and a history of sent requests for easy access. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for developers to test their APIs without needing to switch between different tools.

## Technologies Used

- React: Used for building the user interface of the application.
- TypeScript: Used for type safety and improved developer experience.
- Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to APIs.
- CSS: Used for styling the application and making it visually appealing.
- Material UI: Used for building a responsive and visually consistent user interface.
- Web Development: The project is a web application that runs in the browser, allowing users to test their APIs without needing to install additional software.
- API Testing: The primary purpose of the application is to facilitate API testing, allowing developers to easily create and send HTTP requests, view responses, and manage collections of requests.
